STEP fonts version 2.0.4a
January 2, 2021

The STEP fonts are a free Times-like (i.e., Times replacement) font family,
implementing a design first created for The Times of London in 1932. These fonts
are meant to be compatible in design with Adobe's digitization of Linotype
Times (commonly used in professional publishing).

For basic use of the fonts, simply add the following to your preamble:

\usepackage{step}\usepackage[notext]{stix}

or see the documentation for more details.

The fonts are available under the Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1.
See STEP-COPYING for more details.
