STEP fonts version 2.0
September 15, 2019

The STEP fonts are a free Times-like (i.e., Times replacement) font family, implementing
a design first created for The Times of London in 1932. These fonts are meant to be
compatible in design with Adobeâ€™s digitization of Linotype Times, commonly used in
publishing.

The fonts are available under the Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1. See STEP-COPYING.
