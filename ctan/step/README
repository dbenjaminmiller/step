STEP fonts version 2.0.3
February 9, 2020

The STEP fonts are a free Times-like (i.e., Times replacement) font family,
implementing a design first created for The Times of London in 1932. These fonts
are meant to be compatible in design with Adobeâ€™s digitization of Linotype
Times, commonly used in professional publishing.

For basic use of the fonts, simply invoke:

\usepackage{step,newtxmath}

or see the documentation for more details.

The fonts are available under the Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1.
See STEP-COPYING for more details.
